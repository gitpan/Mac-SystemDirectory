        Creates a list of path strings for the specified directories in the
        specified domains. The list is in the order in which you should
        search the directories.


        *Usage*


            $path  = FindDirectory(NSApplicationDirectory);

        *Returns*


        When called in scalar context this function returns the first
        matching directory. In list context it returns all matching
